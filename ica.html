        <h2>Student Achievement by Claim</h2>
        <p>The student's results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English
            language arts/literacy: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry. These four claims are based on
            California's academic standards, which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in
            grade four. If the student received a score of "No Score Available" for any claim, this means he or she did
            not complete enough items to receive a score in that area. To view a description of the student's
            achievement level claim (i.e., area), select either [Above Standard], [Near Standard], or [Below Standard]
            from the student-level selections available in the table below.</p>

                                rigorous controls used in summative assessment and local results may show some
